Object and Class:
1. Ways to initialize object
-By reference
-By Method
-By Constructor
-----------------------------------

2. What are the different ways to create an object in Java?
-By new keyword
-By newInstance() method
-By clone() method
-By DeSerialization
-By factory method etc.

3. Method:
-User Defined
-Pre-Defined
---------------------
4. Constructor
-It construct the values at the time of object creation
-Two types of constructor-Default(no argue) and with argue constructor
-Constructor name must be same as class name
-No return type
-Constructor can not be abstract,static, final
-We can use access modifier for constructor public, protected,private or default-it controls the object creation.
-If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor...
--------------------------------------------------
5. Java Constructor <=> Java Method
-A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object.	
-A method is used to expose the behavior of an object.

-A constructor must not have a return type.	                
-A method must have a return type.

-The constructor is invoked implicitly.	                    
-The method is invoked explicitly.

-The Java compiler provides a default constructor if you don't have any constructor in a class.	
-The method is not provided by the compiler in any case.

-The constructor name must be same as the class name.	
-The method name may or may not be same as the class name.
-------------------------------------------------------------
6. Java Constructor	Java Method
=>There are many ways to copy the values of one object into another in Java. They are:

-By constructor
-By assigning the values of one object into another
-By clone() method of Object class
-------------------------------------------------------------
7. Static Keyword
